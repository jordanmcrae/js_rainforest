##Introduction
The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with the basics of authentication, authorization, bcrypt, and postgres.

##User Guide
1. Begin by clicking dropdown menu from the "Login" button at the top of the nav, and click on "Sign Up".
2. Fill in all fields.
3. Once registration is complete, proceed to login by clicking the "login" button at the top of the nav.
4. Features will now be available to you that weren't before such as the "Add a Product" link on the nav, and the "edit" / "delete" options on the individual products.


* ***Note: This app does not yet have individual user parameters, so all products can be accessed, edited and deleted by any user. Individual user product management will be added in a later version.
